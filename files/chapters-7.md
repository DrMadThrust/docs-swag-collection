  Insanity: 6 Potential: 0
  
  Reverse coyote demohyper bhop, ultra downright twice, jump through the tiny gap and finish with an upright and up dash pattern. Bonus points are awarded for not doing a crouched bhop through the spinner gap.
  Slightly slower than ASS (quite a bit faster than regular skip!) but will make you the supreme authority of the swag business if you pull this off in a run. A lot easier, only a few frames slower but boring if you only ultra once instead of twice.
