  Insanity: 6 Potential: 0
  
  Reverse coyote demohyper bhop, ultra downright twice, jump through the tiny gap and finish with an upright and up dash pattern. Bonus points are awarded for not doing a crouched bhop through the spinner gap.
  Slightly slower than ASS (quite a bit faster than regular skip!) but will make you the supreme authority of the swag business if you pull this off in a run. A lot easier, only a few frames slower but boring if you only ultra once instead of twice.

  Insanity: 3 Potential: 0
  
  Reverse coyote demohyper bhop, and from there on it's basically the regular skip. Only difference is that you can greed out a right dash instead of doing 2 uprights. Decent save over regular skip, so go for it if for whatever reason you're consistent at that reverse demohyper.

  Insanity: 4 Potential: +1
  
  Reverse coyote demohyper bhop, fly for a bit and then end it off the same way you would end off ASS! Who would have thought that ASS and regular skip could become friends one day. Demo throught the spinner gap highly recommended, but in no way required.
