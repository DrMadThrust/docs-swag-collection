  Enter from a grounded ultra and demohyper very early. Be sure to not wallkick since you usually need to get the corner correction from the first pile of crates. Then hold jump,   input a second jump for the cb and pray to RNGesus that you actually get it (that's why you need the early demohyper). After that it's another demohyper off the towels part,       followed by a classic ultra finish. Maybe RTA-viable. RTA-viable as in maybe someone can do it even once without a mid-room savestate :)
