  Insanity: 5 Potential: ?!
  
  You need assist mode invincibility activated for this strat to work.
  Hyper bhop approximately half a hair retraction earlier than you would for Badeline Boost. Dash upright and cb (very feel-based) into the next screen, from there immediately ultra downright and min height cb again.
  Ultra as late as possible before the cutscene trigger, this should barely let you hit Badeline before the cutscene forces you to walk left into the spikes (that's why you need assist mode). Now, do not skip the cutscene, otherwise the game would progress as usual.
  Talk yourself through the cutscene text and the game should crash randomly mid-dialogue. Done on 1.3.1.2, have fun breaking the game yourself.
