  Insanity: 4 Potential: -2
  
  Grounded ultra after entering with a wavedash (you might need to strafe left a bit after breaking the block before you wavedash), snag some coyote frames and hope that you hit a good cb. If you do, exit this room with a hyper into the next screen. If you don't, well..., we don't talk about that here.

  Insanity: 1+ Potential: +1
  
  Go through the transition with a right demo, buffer and hold jump and right after transition and you will always grab that tiny spike ledge. From there, jump straight up a bit, dash up and buffer a wallbounce and dash downright at the peak to go faster. Hyper out of the room to exit.
  If you ever want to start learning cursed strats, this is a good candidate to begin with. Simple, consistent and only loses a tiny bit of time.
