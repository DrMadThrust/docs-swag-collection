## Intro and Warnings

Welcome to my ultimate collection of every strat I ever clipped!

You're gonna find everything, including but not limited to:
 - Actual fast strats (rarely)
 - Funi fast strats (some of them may lose time)
 - Absolutely insane fast strats (we're talking like 1k attempts to get it once insane)
 - Game breaking stuff

In case you have questions, suggestions or anything else, contact me on Discord under DrMadThrust#5786.

Proceed with caution, braincells and muscle memory may be lost by just browsing this collection.

## Strat Ratings

For browsing and trying experience every strat has been rated in 2 categories: Insanity and Potential

Insanity classifies the difficulty of a strat according to following table:
- 0 "What was the dash key again?" aka HmmClueless
- 1 "Look guys, I know what a hyper is!"
- 2 Requires mainstream speedtech (hypers, supers, ...) and/or decent execution
- 3 Needs advanced tech (cbs, demo-related tech, ...) and/or good execution
- 4 Hard to get right, but definitely possible
- 5 Very inconsistent and a bit stupid (= jank)
- 6 You need to be an actual bot to do this (but still doable)
- 7 Never performed by me in an unspliced attempt

Additonally the Insanity rating is tagged with a + sign after the number if obscure tech is required.
As obscure tech counts: diagonal coyote frames, multiboosts, reverse cbs

Potential classifies how much time a strat saves according to following table:
- ?! Why would anyone ever attempt this in a run
- +2 Loses time against basic strats
- +1 Breaks even with basic strats
- 0 Breaks even with most common strats
- -1 Breaks even with high level strats
- -2 Faster than IL world record level strats
- -3 Fast as frick boii

The ratings have been assigned by a team of independent objective experts (yes, it's all just made up by me).
If you feel like something is classified wrongly, feel free to write me a verbally abusive and non-constructive message on Discord.
