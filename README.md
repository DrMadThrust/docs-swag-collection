## Intro and Warnings

Welcome to my ultimate collection of every strat i ever clipped!

You're gonna find everything, including but not limited to:
 - Actual fast strats (rarely)
 - Funi fast strats (some of them may lose time)
 - Absolutely insane fast strats (we're talking like 1k attempts to get it once insane)
 - Game breaking stuff
 
 Proceed with caution, braincells and muscle memory may be lost by just browsing this collection.

## Strat ratings

For browsing and trying experience every strat has been rated in 2 categories: Insanity and Potential

Insanity classifies the difficulty of a strat according to following table:
- 0  "What was the dash key again?"
- 1  "Look guys, I know what a hyper is!"
- 2  you need to be consistent with mainstream speedtech (wavedashes, supers, ...)
- 3  mid-tier full game material
- 4  high-tier full game material/mid-tier IL stuff
- 5  high-tier IL strats, maybe full game if you need deez frames
- 6  I don't wanna call this "useable" for ILs anymore but idk how to call this
- 7  good stuff to bash your head against in checkpoint-ILs
- 8  useable for crazy-level checkpoint ILs
- 9  kinda insane, probably only for individual rooms
- 10 you need to be an actual bot to do this (but still doable)
- 11 never performed by me in an unspliced attempt
