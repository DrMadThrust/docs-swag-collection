## Intro and Warnings

Welcome to my ultimate collection of every strat i ever clipped!

You're gonna find everything, including but not limited to:
 - Actual fast strats (rarely)
 - Funi fast strats (some of them may lose time)
 - Absolutely insane fast strats (we're talking like 1k attempts to get it once insane)
 - Game breaking stuff
 
 Proceed with caution, braincells and muscle memory may be lost by just browsing this collection.

## Strat ratings

For browsing and trying experience every strat has been rated in 2 categories: Insanity and Potential

Insanity classifies the difficulty of a strat according to following table:
- 0 "What was the dash key again?" aka HmmClueless
- 1 "Look guys, I know what a hyper is!"
- 2 requires mainstream speedtech (hypers, supers, ...) and/or decent execution
- 3 needs advanced tech (cbs, demo-related tech, ...) and/or good execution
- 4 hard to get right, but definitely possible
- 5 very inconsistent and a bit stupid
- 6 you need to be an actual bot to do this (but still doable)
- 7 never performed by me in an unspliced attempt

Additonally the Insanity rating is tagged with a + sign after the number if obscure tech is required.
As obscure tech counts: diagonal coyote frames, multiboosts, reverse cbs
